 ## Dataset Verification Instructions

### Structure Consistency:
The structure of the query must match the corresponding structured data. Ensure all fields are correctly represented (e.g., origin, destination, stops, preferences).

### Project Relevance:
* The query must be related to our project, which is focused on road-based navigation.
* Remove any queries about air travel, waterways, boats, or other unrelated topics.
* Ensure the queries are related to road navigation or multi-destination travel.

### Reporting:
* If you find any issues, note the index number and describe the problem in the comment section.
* If everything looks correct, simply write "No comment" in the comment section.

### How to Fill in the Excel Sheet:
* Index Number: Enter the index number of the query.
* Query: Write the natural language query.
* Structured Data: Enter the corresponding structured data (JSON format).
* Comment:
  * If there are no issues, write "No comment."
  * If thereâ€™s an issue (such as mismatch or irrelevant query), note the index number and describe the issue.
